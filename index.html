        <p>The FED Journey begins here... the Journey to CONQUER FED!!</p>
        <p>
          Today, i met the captain of my FED Journey. Mr Henry, my FED teacher!
          The first thing Mr Henry taught me was about the various HTML tags
          such as &lt;p&gt;...&lt;/p&gt;, &lt;h1&gt;...&lt;/h1&gt;,
          &lt;ul&gt;...&lt;/ul&gt;, &lt;ol&gt;...&lt;/ol&gt; and
          &lt;li&gt;...&lt;/li&gt;. Afterwards, I learnt how we can group
          elemetns together using containers which are created by using the
          &lt;div&gt;...&lt;/div&gt; or &lt;span&gt;...&lt;/span&gt; tags.
          Moving to the theoretical aspect of HTML, I grasped the concept of
          block-level and inline elemetns.
        </p>
        <p>
          After a short 5 mins break, we learnt about how there are 3 core
          pillars of a website, which is HTML, the bones, CSS, the skin and
          HTML, the brain of a website. Initially, i was confused as i didnt
          understand what it meant. However, after Mr Henry elaborated further,
          it all started making sense to me! After learning everything, I put
          101% of my brainpower together to write my FIRST Hello World in HTML
          :D
        </p>
        <p>Great, now I can proudly call myself a front-end devloper!</p>
        <p>
          After this, Mr Henry showed us examples of good and bad websites. We
          were then tasked to form groups of 4s with our classmates to create
          presentation slides on what websites we used frequently, why these
          websites are good. This was a pretty easy task and my group completed
          it within 30 minutes!
        </p>
        <p>
          Moving on, I finally faced the first obstacle in my venture to conquer
          FED. I had to create a "How to make chocolate chip recepie" website
          using HTML. Without wasting any time, I jumped stright into it and
          start working away. Soon, I was done with my website. However the
          recepie website looked like a malfunctioning monotone website created
          in the 90s. It was unacceptable and I was disappointed at my own
          work... So when I reached home, I decided to further study what CSS
          was about to save Mr Henry from seeing my terrible work.
        </p>
        <p>
          After hours of studying, I learnt how CSS could completely transform
          your plain vanilla website into a dark chocolate, double chocolate
          chip with strawberry topping website! I then applied what I had learnt
          into my recepie website and it was a million times better!
        </p>
        <p>
          With that, I came to the end of my first venture to conquer FED!! All
          in all, it was rather smooth sailing and I made it out alive!

          <h3>Week 2 (More HTML & Intro to CSS)</h3>
          <span class="article-line"></span>
        </div>
        <p>Welcome to the second week of my Journey to conquer FED!!</p>
        <p>
          This week, I dived deeper into HTML semantic concepts and began the
          CSS conquest.
        </p>
        <p>
          Today's venture began with Ice-Breakers and lucky students shared
          either 2 truths and one lie or our work ethics, and during this
          Ice-Breaker session, I learnt that I have a classmate who is allergic
          to both peanuts and prawns, is ambidextrous, and classmates who's work
          ethics are being accountable, openminded and strict.
        </p>
        <p>
          After the Ice-Breaker session, Mr Henry taught how HTML5 is able to
          give semantic meaning to a webpage. To do so, we can utilise tags
          suchs as &lt;headder&gt;, &lt;nav&gt;, &lt;article&gt;,
          &lt;section&gt;, &lt;footer&gt; and &lt;main&gt;. While adding
          semantic meaning to a website does not affect the overall look of a
          website, it is important to incoperate semantic meaning to a website
          as it improves the website's accessiblility to users who rely on
          assistive technologies to use the web. And with that, we have
          concluded the introduction to HTML quest!!
        </p>
        <p>
          Next, we moved on to the Introduction to CSS. As a start, Mr Henry
          taught how we could uniquely identify HTML elements using IDs, Classes
          and Pseudo-Classes. Then, he showed us how to add colour, different
          fonts and box modelling concepts on CSS.
        </p>
        <p>
          Finally, with the knowledge learnt so far, multiple hurdles stood
          infront of us to test what we have learnt. The first hurdle was to add
          semantic meaning to a HTML site. The second hurdle, we were tasked to
          create a web development blog which includes a lists, h1, h2 and an
          img minimally. The third hurdle was to Style a webpage's header, h1
          and h2 elements. And the last hurdle was to restyle a webpage's font
          using Google Fonts.
        </p>
        <p>
          After a meticulously conquering each hurdle one at a time, I finally
          conquered them and concluded my 2nd Week's Venture!!
