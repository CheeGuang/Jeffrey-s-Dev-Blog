          <h3>Week 1 (Intro to HTML)</h3>
          <span class="article-line"></span>
        </div>
        <p>The FED Journey begins here... the Journey to CONQUER FED!!</p>
        <p>
          Today, i met the captain of my FED Journey. Mr Henry, my FED teacher!
          The first thing Mr Henry taught me was about the various HTML tags
          such as &lt;p&gt;...&lt;/p&gt;, &lt;h1&gt;...&lt;/h1&gt;,
          &lt;ul&gt;...&lt;/ul&gt;, &lt;ol&gt;...&lt;/ol&gt; and
          &lt;li&gt;...&lt;/li&gt;. Afterwards, I learnt how we can group
          elemetns together using containers which are created by using the
          &lt;div&gt;...&lt;/div&gt; or &lt;span&gt;...&lt;/span&gt; tags.
          Moving to the theoretical aspect of HTML, I grasped the concept of
          block-level and inline elemetns.
        </p>
        <p>
          After a short 5 mins break, we learnt about how there are 3 core
          pillars of a website, which is HTML, the bones, CSS, the skin and
          HTML, the brain of a website. Initially, i was confused as i didnt
          understand what it meant. However, after Mr Henry elaborated further,
          it all started making sense to me! After learning everything, I put
          101% of my brainpower together to write my FIRST Hello World in HTML
          :D
        </p>
        <p>Great, now I can proudly call myself a front-end devloper!</p>
        <p>
          After this, Mr Henry showed us examples of good and bad websites. We
          were then tasked to form groups of 4s with our classmates to create
          presentation slides on what websites we used frequently, why these
          websites are good. This was a pretty easy task and my group completed
          it within 30 minutes!
        </p>
        <p>
          Moving on, I finally faced the first obstacle in my venture to conquer
          FED. I had to create a "How to make chocolate chip recepie" website
          using HTML. Without wasting any time, I jumped stright into it and
          start working away. Soon, I was done with my website. However the
          recepie website looked like a malfunctioning monotone website created
          in the 90s. It was unacceptable and I was disappointed at my own
          work... So when I reached home, I decided to further study what CSS
          was about to save Mr Henry from seeing my terrible work.
        </p>
        <p>
          After hours of studying, I learnt how CSS could completely transform
          your plain vanilla website into a dark chocolate, double chocolate
          chip with strawberry topping website! I then applied what I had learnt
          into my recepie website and it was a million times better!
        </p>
        <p>
          With that, I came to the end of my first venture to conquer FED!! All
          in all, it was rather smooth sailing and I made it out alive!

          <h3>Week 2 (More HTML & Intro to CSS)</h3>
          <span class="article-line"></span>
        </div>
        <p>Welcome to the second week of my Journey to conquer FED!!</p>
        <p>
          This week, I dived deeper into HTML semantic concepts and began the
          CSS conquest.
        </p>
        <p>
          Today's venture began with Ice-Breakers and lucky students shared
          either 2 truths and one lie or our work ethics, and during this
          Ice-Breaker session, I learnt that I have a classmate who is allergic
          to both peanuts and prawns, is ambidextrous, and classmates who's work
          ethics are being accountable, openminded and strict.
        </p>
        <p>
          After the Ice-Breaker session, Mr Henry taught how HTML5 is able to
          give semantic meaning to a webpage. To do so, we can utilise tags
          suchs as &lt;headder&gt;, &lt;nav&gt;, &lt;article&gt;,
          &lt;section&gt;, &lt;footer&gt; and &lt;main&gt;. While adding
          semantic meaning to a website does not affect the overall look of a
          website, it is important to incoperate semantic meaning to a website
          as it improves the website's accessiblility to users who rely on
          assistive technologies to use the web. And with that, we have
          concluded the introduction to HTML quest!!
        </p>
        <p>
          Next, we moved on to the Introduction to CSS. As a start, Mr Henry
          taught how we could uniquely identify HTML elements using IDs, Classes
          and Pseudo-Classes. Then, he showed us how to add colour, different
          fonts and box modelling concepts on CSS.
        </p>
        <p>
          Finally, with the knowledge learnt so far, multiple hurdles stood
          infront of us to test what we have learnt. The first hurdle was to add
          semantic meaning to a HTML site. The second hurdle, we were tasked to
          create a web development blog which includes a lists, h1, h2 and an
          img minimally. The third hurdle was to Style a webpage's header, h1
          and h2 elements. And the last hurdle was to restyle a webpage's font
          using Google Fonts.
        </p>
        <p>
          After a meticulously conquering each hurdle one at a time, I finally
          conquered them and concluded my 2nd Week's Venture!!

          We have came to the third week of Jeffrey's FED Expedition to CONQUER
          FED!!
        </p>
        <p>
          This week started with ice-breakers again! During today's ice-breaker,
          I learnt that I have a classmate who experienced an EARTHQUAKE
          before?!?! Moreover, I also have a classmate who has 3 pet chickens!!
          This week's venture is a really long and technical one.
        </p>
        <p>
          Today, we learnt that we could utilise the &lt;form&gt; Tag to create
          application forms. To allow users to interact with the forms, we can
          use input tags with types "text", "email", "password" and "submit".
          Furthermore, we can make add the placeholder attribute to give users
          context on what to fill in the input. Lastly, we can also make certain
          inputs compulsory by giving them the "required" attribute.
        </p>
        <p>
          Next, we learnt about the selectors in CSS. There are multiple ways to
          select elements such as Descendant Selector and the Grouping Selector.
          When selecting elements in CSS, we are able to utilise the Specificity
          concept to select elements specifically.
        </p>
        <p>
          CSS Box Model. This model is a concept that all define elements with
          Content, Padding, Border and Margin. To help us better understand this
          concept, Mr Henry got 2 of my fellow crewmates to stand beside each
          other said he wants them to have margin-right of 10% on the crewmate
          standing on the left. After this command, there was a wide gap between
          both of them!!
        </p>
        <p>
          Moving on, we learnt about Media Queries. Media Queries are a powerful
          tool to change an element's CSS style based on certain criterias. With
          this, we are able to create responsive websites that can be viewed
          nicely on all devices
        </p>
        <p>
          Here comes the most important part of our class. Flexboxes. Flexbox is
          a way to postion elements in an aesthetically pleasing manner. We can
          make an element into a flex box by adding the "display: flex"
          attribute. Then, to arrange the elements within a flexbox, we can
          utilise attributes such as "flex-direction" and "flex-wrap" and to
          align elements, we can use the "justify-content" and "align-items".

        <p>
          Welcome to the fourth week of Jeffrey's FED Expedition to CONQUER
          FED!!
        </p>
        <p>
          By today, it became a norm to start FED ventures with icebreakers.
          Today's ice-breaker was INTERESTING. I learnt that there are
          classmates in my class who was born from C-Section, has completed NS
          and Mr Henry shared the estimated IT graduates salaries with us!
        </p>
        <p>
          Today's class was not very content heavy as most of the learning
          materials were to be done before today's class.
        </p>
        <p>
          To begin today's class, Mr Henry gave a recap of our class's Week 3
          CA. He then gone through flexbox theories which helped us deepen our
          understanding on flexboxes.
        </p>
        <p>
          Moving on, we played a True or False Game on Git and GitHub. The
          questions were tricky. However, by analysing each question carefully,
          I was able to answer all 6 questions correctly! Mr Henry then gave me
          a bar of Almond Chocolate.
        </p>
        <p>
          Then, we were tasked to show Mr Henry our wireframe that we did before
          coming to today's class. After taking a look at my wireframe, he gave
          me tips on how my wireframe could be done better and shared with me
          about the various font-end frameworks and introduced agile frameworks
          to me.
        </p>
        <p>
          With that, we came to the end of today's venture. Now, our task for
          this week is to officially start work on the Assignment 1!

          <span class="article-line"></span>
        </div>
        <p>
          Welcome to the fifth week of Jeffrey's FED Expedition to CONQUER FED!!
        </p>
        <p>
          This week is rather interesting. This week is White Space Week, a week
          where no ICT students go to school for classes. Instead, we are
          supposed to learn exercise Asynchronous Learning and learn from home.
        </p>
        <p>
          While it is unfortunate that there is no Ice-breakers this week, not
          having to wake up at 7am for class is really great!
        </p>
        <p>
          The work we were tasked to complete this week is to complete a
          LinkedIn Learning course called "Learning the JavaScript Language".
          This course taught me about the various JavaScript's fundamentals.
          Furthermore, at the end of each chapter, there is a short quiz we have
          to complete which tests our understanding of each chapter.
        </p>
        <p>
          The course started introducing us to the Variables and various Data
          Types. This chapter was a breeze, as it was similar to the variables
          and Data Types we know from Python and C#.
        </p>
        <p>
          Moving on, we learnt about Objects, Arrays, Comments and Regular
          Expressions. Something new I learnt in this chapter was Regular
          Expressions. Regular Expression is a tool we can use to process
          strings and also helps ensure the input string by a user is in the
          correct format.
        </p>
        <p>
          The next chapter was about Operators and Control Structures. One key
          highlight about this chapter is learning what Ternary Operators are.
          Ternary Operators follow the following syntax "condition ?
          expressionIfTrue : expressionIfFalse;". They a shorthand version of an
          if-else statement and is often used for simple, inline conditionals.
        </p>
        <p>
          The following chapter was about Iteration with Loops. This chapter was
          also a breeze, as the concepts are similar to C#. However, a new topic
          i learnt was the Set and Map Data Types. Set is used to store each
          value exactly once, while Map is used to store key-value pairs whilst
          preserving the order of keys.
        </p>
        <p>
          Then, we learnt about Functions in JavaScript. This chapter was
          slightly challenging as we learnt about new syntax to define
          functions, called an in-line function. This allows us to store
          functions in a variable which make the code more concise and readable.
        </p>
        <p>
          Finally, we learnt about Asynchronous Functions. This type of function
          is extremely powerful, as it allows multiple functions to execute in a
          parallel manner, which improves a website's responsiveness.
        </p>
        <p>
          After taking almost a day on this course, I was finally done! And as a
          token to recognise my effort, I was awarded a Certificate of
          Completion for this "Learning the JavaScript Language" Course, and I

          Welcome to the sixth week of Jeffrey's FED Expedition to CONQUER FED!!
        </p>
        <p>
          For this week, we are solidifying what we have learnt during the Week
          5's Whitespace week in class.
        </p>
        <p>
          Today's class started with the usual ice-breakers! From this, I learnt
          that one of my classmate enjoys dancing and another classmate playes
          the drums.
        </p>
        <p>
          To begin today's class Mr Henry went through what we learnt during
          Whitespace Week. He taught us about old JS Variables such as var, and
          modern JS Variables such as let and const. Then, we learnt about the
          differences between "===" and "==". He said that "===" will compare if
          the value and data type of 2 data are equal, while "==" will only
          compare if the value of 2 data are equal. Moving on, we learnt about
          For and While Loops. He mentioned that in his working experience, he
          used For loops more regularly and While loops only in special cases.
        </p>
        <p>
          After that, we learnt about Arrays and Objects. Arrays are
          conventionally used to store a list of data with the same Data Type,
          while Objects can be used to store data with various data types.
          Furthermore, we learnt how we can use functions to follow the "don't
          repeat yourself" best practise.
        </p>
        <p>
          Mr Henry then taught us about the purpose of learning various
          programming languages. He told us how people use Python in data
          science, machine learning and artificial intellience. Then, he shared
          that Java/C# is used for enterprising and backend processing. Lastly,
          we learn JavaScript as it is the only language that can run on
          browsers. As additonal information, Mr Henry shared how in the past,
          website are built completely on Java nd C#. He said how the
          disadvantages of this is that whenever a user performs an action, the
          whole page will reload. This is extremely inefficient and redundant.
          However, JavaScript is able to utilise fetch function to fetch data
          from a database and do some DOM manupiulation to update the website
          without reloading it completely.
        </p>
        <p>
          Now, we have completed Week 5's recap and are moving on to new
          content. This week, we are learning about Object Oriented Programming
          in JavaScript.
        </p>
        <p>
          To create Objects, we use the following syntax {"name" : "Jeffrey",
          "height" : 171, "speak" : function speak(){...}}. With objects, we are
          allowed to create
        </p>
        <p>
          Diving deeper into var, let and const, we learnt that the difference
          between them are their scopes. Var variables are function scoped,
          while let variables are block scoped. Using var variables are
          considered a bad practise and should be avoided.
